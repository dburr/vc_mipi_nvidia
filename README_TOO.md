# Additional Notes

Setting the following environment variables while running `quickstart.sh`
(or any of the other scripts) will alter their behavior as follows:

* setting `SKIP_RECOVERY_MODE_CHECK="YES"` will skip the check for a board in recovery mode, allowing the scripts to be run even without the presence of such a board
* setting `DEBUG="YES"` will print copious debugging information
